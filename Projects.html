                As an exploration of PCB design for ECE 1100, I completed a two-part discovery project with a design component and a hands-on component.
            </p>
            <h2 class="subheading2">>> Design Stage | Eagle PCB</h2>
                <p class="subtext2">
                    Central to designing a PCB is the CAD software used to select parts and create a layout. Upon the recommendation of other ECE majors and my peer leader from ECE 1100, I decided to introduce myself to Eagle PCB using online tutorials, with the goal of designing a PCB schematic and board.
                    <br><br>
                    I started by downloading the Eagle software and doing some preliminary research into its use, including watching tutorial videos, I decided to make use of the soldering training board designed by Robojackets, which I would later physically solder at the Hive, to practice designing something in Eagle without a 1:1 video tutorial. 
                    <br><br>
                    The first step was to create a schematic (.sch) file and select all of the parts. While several of the parts, particularly the simple resistors, capacitors, and LEDs, were available within the pre-downloaded Eagle libraries, many of the more unique parts for the project were not available. I used the minimal information provided on the training PDF to Google each missing part and find the correct one.
                    <br><br>
                    I ended up finding most of the required models, symbols, and footprints on SnapEDA, but two, the fuse (F1) and the MOSFET (Q1), had to be downloaded from separate websites. I decided not to consolidate the libraries to keep track of where each part came from.
                </p>

                    Left: the 3 user-provided libaries I used. <br> Right: the SnapEDA library I downloaded.

                <p class="subtext2">
                    <br>
                    Designing the schematic presented the challenge of interpreting the images provided for the soldering training, which were not exact schematics. After placing down all of the parts, I completed a first run through of adding all of the nets, also including nets on leads that were grounded using a trace leading to a through-hole. 
                </p>

                    The first complete draft of the schematic, without the extra headers that were not required for the soldering training. This draft came after starting the new board file, as I noticed and fixed some errors only after working on the board.
                </p>
                <p class="subtext2">
                    <br>
                    The next step was to start the board file. I initially faced some challenges with asynchronous schematic editing, resulting in a severance of the connection between the two. After making sure the board and schematic matched, I ended up following through with placing all of the components in their correct spots, drawing in the traces with 45-degree angles and avoiding same-side overlap, adding in through holes (for grounded components, using vias), and completing the copper pour on the bottom layer.
                </p>

                    <br>
                    The IC (part U1) still needed some work at this stage. Under the center of the component was a thermal pad connected to an array of 6 vias/through-holes just below the IC, which I could only add in the board file, not the schematic.

            <h2 class="subheading2">>> Hands-On Stage | PCB Soldering Training</h2>
                <p class="subtext2">
                    The hands-on stage of my project involved getting to actually participate in the Robojackets Soldering Training session at Georgia Tech's Interdisciplinary Design Commons, an ECE makespace run by The Hive, a student organization. The board actually does have a purpose--when used with an Arduino Uno, it can power a DC motor, if created properly.
                    <br><br>
                    The soldering skills required were more complex than the simple through-hole soldering experience I already had. I had to use surface-mount components, many of which were too small to handle without tweezers, which took some getting used to.

                    <br>
                    Unfortunately, the time alotted for the session was not enough time to reach the testing stage with the Arduino. However, I got experience with physical debugging, namely by using the continuity checker and voltage reader of a multimeter to analyze the different connections in my PCB.
