                As an exploration of PCB design for ECE 1100, I completed a two-part discovery project with a design component and a hands-on component.
            </p>
            <h2 class="subheading2">>> Design Stage | Eagle PCB</h2>
                <p class="subtext2">
                    Central to designing a PCB is the CAD software used to select parts and create a layout. Upon the recommendation of other ECE majors and my peer leader from ECE 1100, I decided to introduce myself to Eagle PCB using online tutorials, with the goal of designing a PCB schematic and board.
                    <br><br>
                    I started by downloading the Eagle software and doing some preliminary research into its use, including watching tutorial videos, I decided to make use of the soldering training board designed by Robojackets, which I would later physically solder at the Hive, to practice designing something in Eagle without a 1:1 video tutorial. The board's main purpose was to drive a DC motor and turn on some LEDs (described in further detail in the hands-on stage below).
                    <br><br>
                    The first step was to create a schematic (.sch) file and select all of the parts. While several of the parts, particularly the simple resistors, capacitors, and LEDs, were available within the pre-downloaded Eagle libraries, many of the more unique parts for the project were not available. I used the minimal information provided on the training PDF to Google each missing part and find the correct one.
                    <br><br>
                    I ended up finding most of the required models, symbols, and footprints on SnapEDA, but two, the fuse (F1) and the MOSFET (Q1), had to be downloaded from separate websites. I decided not to consolidate the libraries to keep track of where each part came from.
                </p>

                <p class="subtext2">
                    <br>
                    Designing the schematic presented the challenge of interpreting the images provided for the soldering training, which were not exact schematics. After placing down all of the parts, I completed a first run through of adding all of the nets, also including nets on leads that were grounded using a trace leading to a through-hole.
                </p>

                    The first complete draft of the schematic, without the extra headers that were not required for the soldering training. This draft came after starting the new board file, as I noticed and fixed some errors only after working on the board.
                </p>
                <p class="subtext2">
                    <br>
                    The next step was to start the board file. I initially faced some challenges with asynchronous schematic editing, resulting in a severance of the connection between the two. After making sure the board and schematic matched, I ended up following through with placing all of the components in their correct spots, drawing in the traces with 45-degree angles and avoiding same-side overlap, adding in through holes and bottom-layer connections, and completing copper pours on both layers.

                    The IC (U1) still needed some work at this stage. Under the center of the component was a thermal pad connected to an array of 6 vias/through-holes just below the IC, which I could only add in the board file, not the schematic.

            <h2 class="subheading2">>> Hands-On Stage | PCB Soldering Training</h2>
                <p class="subtext2">
                    The hands-on stage of my project involved getting to actually participate in the Robojackets Soldering Training session at Georgia Tech's Interdisciplinary Design Commons, an ECE makespace run by The Hive, a student organization. When used as a Shield with an Arduino Uno running the correct program, the board is intended to power a DC motor, if soldered properly and debugged.
                    <br><br>
                    The soldering skills required were more complex than the simple through-hole soldering experience I already had. I had to use surface-mount components, many of which were too small to handle without tweezers, which took some getting used to.

                <p class="subtext2">
                    <br>
                    While the time alotted for the session was not enough to reach the testing stage with the Arduino, I was able to gain experience with physical debugging, namely by using the continuity checker and voltage reader of a multimeter to analyze the different connections on the PCB. I discovered an open continuity on the fuse, so I used the solder wick and desoldering pump to remove and replace the connection. A similar issue arose with some of the pins on the IC, so I re-soldered the component in its entirety.
                    <br><br>
                    After the training session, I was able to test out some of the functions of the PCB with my roommate's Arduino Uno and a DC motor. The headers fit into the Arduino's ports properly, and loading the code with the training successfully lit up LED2. However, the lack of capacitor C3 (which we were instructed not to solder on) likely inhibited the remaining LEDs and DC motor from working. I plan to bring the PCB back to the Hive to see what I can try to make the software run properly and resolder components that are either faulty or improperly soldered.  
                    <br><br>
                    Ultimately, the experience was effective in giving me much-needed surface-mount soldering experience, especially with small components, and the relatively supervision-free nature of the experience let me figure out issues with solders on my own.
                </p>
            <h2 class="subheading2">Recap</h2>
                <p class="subtext2">
                    Overall, the project's two stages were both able to introduce me to techniques and knowledge important to the field of ECE as a whole. Being able to lay circuits onto PCBs and interpret signals from a prototype for debugging are important skills for any ECE major, but my threads of Circuit Technology and Signal & Information Processing are especially relevant, and I feel that my decision has been reinforced by this project.
